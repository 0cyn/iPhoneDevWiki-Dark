# iPhoneDevWiki-Dark

Chrome Extension to apply a dark MediaWiki theme to the iPhoneDevWiki

PRs welcome. This will not be on the chrome extension store because I am not going to pay them $5.

### Installation

Pick a directory, any of them work

`git clone https://github.com/KritantaDev/iPhoneDevWiki-Dark.git`

Open chrome, click the icon on the far top right, open extensions. 

Enable Developer mode, click load unpacked, navigate to your copy of this repository, and click open

Enjoy :)
